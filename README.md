# Hey ðŸ‘‹ I'm Gyan  

I work on backend systems, databases, cloud, and security, with a focus on building scalable solutions. Currently exploring Spring Boot, React Native, and DevOps, with hands-on experience in security and bug hunt

I often explore startups, apps, and ideas; some work, some donâ€™t, but each one teaches me something new
