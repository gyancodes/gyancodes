# Hey ðŸ‘‹ I'm Gyan  

I like building things mostly tinkering with backend systems, databases, security, and the cloud, learning how to build things that scale.   
Mostly exploring startups, apps, and ideas sometimes they work, sometimes they donâ€™t, but I always learn.  


##### What Iâ€™m into  
- Experimenting with AI, fintech, and travel apps  
- Writing small tools for fun + learning  

##### Currently  
- Working on personal projects like **ThoughtBox** (a minimal notes app)  
- Exploring app ideas around **travel** and **AI assistants**
